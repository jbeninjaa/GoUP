# GoUp
Go is a 2D platformer and infinite vertical scroller where players ascend using a projectile launcher. The difficulty increases with challenges like moving platforms, spawning enemies, and physics-based puzzles as they progress. Players score points by climbing higher, avoiding collision damage. The game features permadeath, meaning all progress is lost upon death, requiring players to start over from the beginning each time.
